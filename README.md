# Assembly
These are assorted projects for my CMPE 102 (Assembly) class at university.

This project is using x86 Windows MASM.

## Random stuff
These are just random off projects seeing what I can do in assembly.
Currently working on:
  - Console I/O (puts, printf ...)
  - String Operations (strncpy, concat ...)
  - String Conversions (itoa, ftoa ...)

## Project 1
